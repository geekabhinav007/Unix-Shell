# Unix-Shell
The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived because itâ€™s a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.
